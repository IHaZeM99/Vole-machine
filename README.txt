Adam_README:

Overview:
This program processes Arabic text and makes specific word replacements based on the provided configuration files.

Requirements:

To run this program successfully, you must include the following files:

  1- arabic_output.txt: This file is the default save file for the program (just in case user wants to save the modified file without creating a new file with a new name). It must be included in the same directory as the executable when running the program.

  2- replacements.txt: This file contains the pairs of words to be replaced in the text. Make sure to include it to ensure that the required word replacements are processed correctly.


Example:
 
 The arabic_input.txt and arabic_output.txt are example for some words and how the program can replace the words correctly
 (Note: arabic_output.txt must be included with file.cpp to run the program without any problem unlike the arabic_input.txt file,
 any input text file will work)


Note:

1- Make sure to include the necessary files to avoid any runtime errors. The program relies on the replacements.txt and arabic_output.txt  files to perform the word replacements and saving accurately.

2- if you are using clion make sure to put all text files in cmake-build-debug folder, else just put text files beside the file.cpp
